Modules

Modules organize the and and declared with a class annotated
by a decorator module.

Modules allow us to break the app into smaller component

1. Auth Module
For the first time it's better to learn to create it on your own not by generator.
The Auth Module will be stored in auth folder

auth
|- auth.module.ts => the auth module file

2. User module
To generate the module, you can use this command:
nest g module user

After the module generated, it will be auto imported in app module

user
|- user.module.ts => user module file

3. Bookmark module
To generate the module, you can use this command:
nest g module bookmark

After the module generated, it will be auto imported in app module

bookmark
|- bookmark.module.ts => bookmark module file
